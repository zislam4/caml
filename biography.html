	<p>As an Associate Professor of Psychology at Tufts University I spend my time investigating the subjective experience that accompanies memories.  My research encompasses  metacognition, memory distortion, eyewitness memory, and age related changes in memory.  I received my  Ph.D. in Cognitive Psychology from the University of Washington, and then spent three years as an NIA postdoctoral fellow at Washington University.  I spent a final year at Wash U as a research scientist, studying changes in long-term memory as a function of aging. After teaching at Colby College for two years, I came to the Department of Psychology at Tufts University, where I established the Cognitive Aging and Memory Lab in 2007.   Graduate and Undergraduate students interested in working in the Cognitive Aging and Memory Lab should contact me at <a href="mailto:ayanna.thomas@tufts.edu">ayanna.thomas@tufts.edu</a></p>
      <p>My research has been funded by grants from  the National Institute on Aging and National Institute of Neurological Disorder  and Stroke, and has been featured in such popular media outlets as <em>Psychology Today, The Initiative for  Neuroscience and the Law,</em> and the <em>L.A.  Times</em>. </p>
